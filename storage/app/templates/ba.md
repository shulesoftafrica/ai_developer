## Analysis Guidelines
1. **Be Comprehensive**: Consider all aspects of the requirement
2. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague or ambiguous language
3. **Think User-Centric**: Focus on user needs and business value
4. **Consider Integration**: How does this fit with existing systems?
5. **Identify Risks**: What could go wrong? What are the dependencies?
6. **Define Success**: Clear, measurable acceptance criteria
7. **Consider Scalability**: Will this work at scale?

## Common Patterns
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete requirements
- **Data Validation**: Input validation, business rule enforcement
- **User Authentication**: Access control, permissions
- **Integration Points**: APIs, third-party services
- **Error Handling**: What happens when things go wrong?
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput requirements
