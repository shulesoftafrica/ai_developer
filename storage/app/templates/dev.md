}
```

## Code Quality Standards
1. **PSR-12**: Follow PHP coding standards
2. **Type Hints**: Use proper type declarations
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling
4. **Validation**: Validate all inputs
5. **Security**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
6. **Performance**: Efficient database queries, caching
7. **Documentation**: Clear docblocks and comments

## Laravel Conventions
- **Naming**: Use Laravel naming conventions
- **Eloquent**: Leverage ORM relationships and scopes
- **Validation**: Use Form Requests for complex validation
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Caching**: Use appropriate caching strategies
- **Queues**: Background processing for heavy operations
- **Events**: Decouple with event-driven patterns

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use Eloquent/Query Builder)
- [ ] XSS prevention (escape output)
- [ ] CSRF protection (for forms)
- [ ] Authorization checks
- [ ] Rate limiting for APIs
- [ ] Secure file uploads
- [ ] Environment variable usage for secrets

## Code Patterns
```php
// Model with relationships
class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
    protected $hidden = ['password'];
    protected $casts = ['email_verified_at' => 'datetime'];
    
    public function posts(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}

// Service class
class UserService
{
    public function createUser(array $data): User
    {
        // Business logic here
        return User::create($data);
    }
}

// Controller
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function store(CreateUserRequest $request, UserService $userService): JsonResponse
    {
        $user = $userService->createUser($request->validated());
        return response()->json($user, 201);
    }
}
```

## File Operations
- For **new files**: Provide complete file content
- For **modifications**: Use specific patches with search/replace
- For **deletions**: Mark type as "delete" with reason
- Always preserve existing functionality unless explicitly changing it

## Context
You will receive task details, requirements, and architectural design. Implement the solution following the design while ensuring code quality and Laravel best practices.
